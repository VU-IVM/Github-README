# VU-IVM Github README 

Here we explain how you can connect your repository to the VU-IVM page. \

## Option 1: Fork your existing Github repository
Become a member, send an email to one of the repo maintainers (e.g. sem.vijverberg@vu.nl). \
Once you are part of the VU-IVM Github institution: \
Go to personal github repo \
Click on Fork (upper right of page), then you should see the organization which you are linked to. \

## Option 2: Connect an existing local repository 

git init \
git add . \
git commit -m "First commit‚Äù \
git branch -v # verifies the new local branch \ 
*Now you have a local branch called master, now we also need to connect the local version control to a remote URL. \
Go to https://github.com/VU-IVM \
Click New (green icon, on the right of VU-IVM Github page) \
Fill in Repository name \
Add description (optional) \
Optional to Initialize this repository with a README. \
If you initialized a repo, click on the green Clone or Download button and copy the Github-link, if not, you enter a webpage with more detailed instruction how to set up you repo. \
You only have to copy the Github-link, .e.g. https://github.com/VU-IVM/{your_repo_name}.git \
Now you can connect you local folder to the remote repository. \
git remote add origin https://github.com/VU-IVM/{your_repo_name}.git \
git remote -v # verifies the new remote URL \
git push -u origin master \
Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as origin \
After you have run git push -u origin master, it will automaticallly push your next updates to the origin if you only write: \
git push


# Connect your practicum assignment to Binder:

Fill in you Git-URL: \
https://github.com/VU-IVM/{your_repo_name}.git \
the branch you want to publish: \
generally the master branch
